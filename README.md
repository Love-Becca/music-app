The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm  install react-router-dom`
Used this command to install react router,
then I import BrowserRouter,Routes and Route into app.js and surrounded all components with the browser Router and the likes☝. With the react router I can navigate through pages.
I ended up using nested route and its so cool.
http://localhost:3000/music -- Music
